# WooCommerce Checkout Integration Example 1

An example that shows you how to conditionally hide shipping and payment options in the [Cart and Checkout blocks](https://woocommerce.com/checkout-blocks/).

The new Cart and Checkout blocks are part of the [WooCommerce Blocks](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/) plugin, and were built from the ground up to deliver a conversion-optimized checkout experience that is fully customizable in the WordPress Block Editor. 

The code in this repository is explained [in this guide](#). Studying this example will help you get a better understanding of how to:

- [Expose custom data](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/blob/trunk/docs/extensibility/extend-rest-api-add-data.md) in the responses of existing Store API routes.
- Prepare your plugin to build modern JavaScript (ES6/React) code.
- Register and enqueue your front-end script, and make options and settings available to it. And finally:
- Hide shipping and payment options in the Checkout block.
